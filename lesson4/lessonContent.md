**Code Examples:**

```
# Example: Calculating F1 Score
# precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
# recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
# F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
```

**Quizzes:**

**Which metric is used to balance precision and recall?**

- Accuracy
- Loss Function
- F1 Score

**Answer:** F1 Score

### Agent Testing Methods

Common methods include unit tests, integration tests, and simulation testing. Each testing type serves a unique role in ensuring the AI agent performs as intended.

**Code Examples:**

```
# Example of a unit test in Python
import unittest
class TestAgent(unittest.TestCase):
 def test_behavior(self):
 self.assertEqual(agent.action(), expected_action)
```

**Quizzes:**

**What is the purpose of unit tests?**

- Test the entire system
- Test individual components
- Test graphical interfaces

**Answer:** Test individual components

### Continuous Evaluation and Feedback Loops

Implementing continuous evaluation through feedback loops allows AI agents to adapt and improve over time. This is crucial in dynamic environments where conditions change frequently.

**Video URL:** http://video.com/evaluationFeedbackLoops

**Code Examples:**

```
# Feedback loop in pseudocode
for each interaction:
 result = agent.interact()
 performance_metrics = evaluate(result)
 agent.update(performance_metrics)
```
